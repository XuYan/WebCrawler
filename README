This is a python webpage crawler that takes css selectors as inputs and outputs information you care to a file.
It works like a pipe. User specifies a start url and multiple CSS selectors.
Applying the first CSS selector to the start url webpage will redirect to a second webpage,
to which we apply the second CSS selector will lead us to the third webpage, so on and so forth.
The whole process works recursively util the last CSS selector is used to get final results.
